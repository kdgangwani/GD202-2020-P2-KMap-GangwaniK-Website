            <div id="grid-item"><h1>Expanding the Farmers Market Culture</h1> <p>In a time when food sources have seemed to oversaturate certain neighborhoods, the number of options to get one’s groceries from is only growing. Consequently, long-running farmers market vendors have witnessed a decline in the number of shoppers over twenty to thirty years. To these vendors, it is primarily the loyal shoppers who have been faithful for decades that allow these markets to survive. Nevertheless, despite many expansions made in both conventional and alternative food sources, a large portion of communities are persistently left disregarded in terms of access to healthy and local food. Once farmers markets take advantage of catering to these underserved demographics by addressing their limitations and public perceptions, they are able to continue growing amidst a competitive market.</p></div></div>

                <div id="grid-item"><h2>Perceptions of Farmers Markets</h2><p>Public perceptions of farmers markets amongst marginalized communities hinder their willingness to participate, as explored by Alkon, Hope, and Mccullen in their research conducted in 2010. Due to the extensive impact of racial divide ensued from legislation and housing development, Alkon et al. discusses the manners through which the intersection between race and class further emphasizes the need for alternative food sources to reach out to these complex and diverse communities. The implied “whiteness” that is internalized in farmers market spaces due to the primarily white-majority community of farmers may discomfort shoppers of color. The tone with which many AFS systems reach out to communities of color resemble an attitude of “white saviorism” due to the color-blind ways in which the ties between land ownership and racial privilege are obscured. Furthermore, Alkon et al. expands their research into claiming that “such spaces are shaped by a set of white cultural practices”; thus, these ingrained practices include commodifying rural practices in a fetishizing manner and rather obscuring the farmers’ identities into one monolithic image that is sold as a trend. Furthermore, resorting to the “support your local farmer” dialogue lacks appeal to communities who cannot afford to support anybody outside their household. Consequently, these subtle actions function as microaggressions and further demonstrate the narrative of romanticizing white rural culture and dominance.</p></div>
                
                <div id="grid-item"><h2>Successful Farmers Markets</h2><p>Developing successful and effective strategies to promote farmers' markets to disregarded consumers has proven to be beneficial for both shoppers and vendors overtime. Larimore’s recent study in 2017 observes how the cultural boundaries inhibiting large groups of people have been overcome by certain methods that have been carefully curated to adapt for certain communities. Firstly, the development of culturally educational materials and collaboration with public schools to have children visit nearby farmers markets fosters an entire age range to explore these better eating habits that they may have not had exposure to otherwise. Due to the lack of knowledge around preparing raw produce, many people are deterred from the idea of having to spend more time preparing meals in an unfamiliar way. With the combination of educational material that is approachable and not patronizing alongside heavily marketed components pertaining to federally implemented benefits, the adoption of participating in farmers markets can be facilitated amongst a wider range of consumers.<br><br> Relaying healthful cooking approaches and the long-term benefits of buying local has proven to ease hesitant consumers’ reluctance to invest more in their food, thereby creating a symbiotic relationship between vendors and customers. For people in marginalized communities, most often they do not have the privilege to listen and consider ethical imperatives as a means to find motivation through supporting other communities like farmers when they are in need of support themselves. Hence, as observed in these consolidation of these studies, it is imperative to appeal to newer consumer bases through education that relies more on logical means of rhetoric that allows for clear explanation of advantages and processes, unlike the heavy utilization of emotional rhetorical appeal that tends to oversimplify and undermine new and possibly foreign consumer bases. This generalized logical approach is then often balanced with a marketing campaign that caters to a diverse consumer base, leading to more engagement from a variety of people. Once these values are implemented into the execution of publicizing farmers markets, these venues can realize their full potential as a welcoming environment that benefits all consumers in a non-exclusionary way.</p></div>
