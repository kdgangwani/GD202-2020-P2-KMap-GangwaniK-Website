            <div id="grid-item"><h1>What is the State Farmers Market?</h1><p>30,000 square feet for North Carolina farmers to sell fresh produce, plants, and other specialty items produced on local farms.  Plants are available starting in March and local fruits and vegetables are sold throughout the growing season.  This is where you can find the freshest and widest variety of produce and plants in the area. <br><br>&#8594;&nbsp;<i>From the <a href = "http://www.ncagr.gov/markets/facilities/markets/raleigh/index.htm" target="_blank">State Farmers Market</a> website.</i></p></div>

                <div id="grid-item"><h1>Origins of the Market</h1><p>In 1955 the very first State Farmer’s Market was constructed on a 17-acre site in another part of Raleigh by a private developer.  In 1958 he opened a “Farmers Section” which was leased to the NC Department of Agriculture for operation and maintenance. The NCDA then purchased the Farmer’s Market in 1961, and continues operating all State-owned Farmers Markets across North Carolina.<br><br> By the mid 1970s, the old State Farmers Market had grown beyond its capacity and had become unable to accommodate the swelling number of sellers and buyers. In 1979 a United States Department of Agriculture study indicated the need for expansion and improved facilities. The site chosen for the new facility was the NCDA dairy farm near the Dorothea Dix Hospital. This site offered access to Interstate 40 and was convenient for most of the farmers to bring their products to markets. <br><br>&#8594;&nbsp;<i>From the <a href = "http://www.realbiscuits.com/about.html" target="_blank">State Farmers Market Restaurant</a> website.</i></p></div>
             <div id="grid-item"><h1>Personal Observations</h1><p>As someone who had never visited the Raleigh State Farmers Market and not as familiar with the culture and communities that are prevalent in this particular venue, I was initially not knowing what to expect or how to judge the environment. Moreover, I perceived farmers markets as places for niche groups of people that could afford to purchase produce at higher price ranges, so I was under the misperception that the demographic of vendors may comprise primarily of senior citizens.<br><br>However, after visiting the market on multiple occasions and witnessing the interactions of some of the regular vendors and shoppers, I realized quickly that the market was a space for relationships beyond its primary purpose of commerce. The vendors would socialize with one another and were a tightly-knit community, along with the loyal customers who would actively initiate conversations. The way the space is laid out also helps in contributing to the social activity of the market. The space is divided into three columns essentially, with the middle column being utilized as a wider walking space for the shoppers. Due to this arrangement, shoppers are almost constantly surrounded by vendors and produce on both sides. Especially on Saturday mornings, which is the busiest time at the market, new shoppers may even feel overwhelmed by the abundance of options that are laid out on each booth. </p></div>
