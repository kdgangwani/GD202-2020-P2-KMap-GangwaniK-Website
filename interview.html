                <h2>Can you tell us a little more about your farm, like where it’s located?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp; We are located in the Brushy Mountains of North Carolina, which is near Boone, NC. We take 421-North out of Winston Salem and go through Yadkinville into Wilkes County--and as you get into Wilkes County, we take Hwy 16 North, and our packing house is on the right-hand side. The farm, or some of the land, is located behind the Apple House on top of the Brushy Mountains and down Mount Olive (?) Church Road.<br><br>
                    <b>Gene Lee</b> &nbsp; Our farm started in ‘75, and we’re still trying to hang on. We are from the Johnston County area.</p>
                        
                <h2>How long have you been selling at the Farmers’ Market?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp; We’ve been here for over 25 years. A long time!
            <br><br>
                    <b>Gene Lee</b> &nbsp; We’ve been here for twelve years now.</p>
            
                <h2>Have any other vendors been here that long?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp; Yes they have, most of those people on the far-left side have been here since the doors opened.
            <br><br><b>Gene Lee</b> &nbsp; I know everybody out here, everybody’s, you know, like a family!</p>

                <h2>Do you sell here everyday?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp; We are open 7 days a week, 12 months of the year, closed Christmas Day of course and on the days when it might not be safe for the public to be out here due to snow. We are very faithful!<br><br>
            <b>Gene Lee</b> &nbsp;We are open 7 days a week, all year round.</p>

                <h2>How often do you make the trip from the farm?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp;In the summertime we come every single day because we pick fresh peaches and sell them here. October and November we come every day because we pick fresh apples, as well.</p>

                <h2>Do you have customers you see on a weekly basis?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp;That’s what keeps us going! It’s faithful customers, they come every day or once a week. There’s some that actually come everyday for lunch from Downtown that work for the State. We have doctors that come for lunch here; they’ll eat lunch and then come here and buy from us. But yes, this is what keeps us going, it’s people that are faithful to us.</p>

                <h2>Since Raleigh has gotten a lot bigger in recent years, have you found that you have more buyers now than when you started selling here?</h2>
            <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp;No, we have a different clientele and times have changed where people are buying less in smaller packages. But they’re still coming and still buying. I think a lot of it is that there are a lot of smaller markets that have sprung up all over Raleigh, Holly Springs, Apex, Cary, and I think it’s just kinda split up the clientele to visit other places, but we still have a large crowd that comes here. And there’s room to grow, I believe we’re gonna grow.
            <br><br>
            <b>Gene Lee</b> &nbsp;Years ago it used to be busier. A lot of people nowadays, you know, everything is in season. Things like cabbage aren’t an everyday thing but it works out.</p>

                <h2> Why might people be buying less?</h2>
                <p><b>Cindy Lowe</b> &nbsp;I think it’s just that they’re shopping at other farmers markets, and younger people are buying less but they’re still coming, and that’s what is important!<br><br>
            <b>Gene Lee</b> &nbsp;A lot of older generations are still coming. A lot of the newer customers don't can anymore, they don’t freeze, they buy what they need at the moment. But we still have old ones who buy in bulk and freeze and can.</p>
